Implementation Details:

1. Create the following components:
   a. FireCalculator (main component)
   b. FireForm (input form)
   c. FireResults (results display)

2. Implement FireCalculator:

   - Manage state for form inputs and calculation results
   - Render FireForm and FireResults
   - Implement calculation logic or use a custom hook

3. Implement FireForm:

   - Create form inputs for:
     - Current Age
     - Current Savings
     - Annual Income
     - Annual Expenses
     - Investment Return (slider)
     - Inflation Rate (slider)
     - Tax Rate (slider)
     - Career Growth Rate (slider)
     - Career Growth Slowdown Age
     - Additional Retirement Expenses (dynamic list)
     - Kids Expenses (optional, with toggle)
     - Parents Care Expenses (optional, with toggle)
   - Use TailwindCSS for styling
   - Implement form validation

4. Implement FireResults:

   - Display calculation results:
     - Age of Financial Independence
     - Years until FIRE
     - Final Net Worth
     - Projected Annual Expenses at FIRE (in today's dollars)
     - Real Investment Return (after inflation)
   - Create charts using Chart.js:
     - Net Worth Projection
     - Expenses Projection

5. Create a utility function for FIRE calculations:

   - Account for all input parameters
   - Calculate year-by-year projections
   - Determine FIRE age based on when investment returns cover expenses
   - Return detailed results for display and charting

6. Implement responsive design using TailwindCSS
7. Add proper error handling and user feedback
8. Optimize performance and implement accessibility features

Start by creating the project structure and implementing the FireCalculator component.
