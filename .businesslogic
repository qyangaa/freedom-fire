# FIRE Calculator Business Logic

## Current Implementation

### Core Calculations (fireCalculations.ts)

1. Inflation Handling

   - All input values are in today's dollars
   - All displayed results are in today's dollars (real values)
   - Internal calculations handle nominal values with inflation adjustments
   - Conversion formulas:
     - Future nominal value = Today's value × (1 + inflationRate)^years
     - Today's value = Future nominal value ÷ (1 + inflationRate)^years

2. Total Expenses Calculation

   - Base annual expenses (input in today's dollars)
   - Additional expenses (input in today's dollars)
   - For each projection year:
     - Nominal expenses = Today's expenses × (1 + inflationRate)^years
     - Display value converted back to today's dollars
   - Categories:
     - Basic living expenses (grows with general inflation)
     - Additional retirement expenses (grows with general inflation)
     - Kids expenses (grows with general inflation)
     - Parents care expenses (grows with general inflation)

3. Income Calculation

   - Base annual income (input in today's dollars)
   - Career growth phases:
     - Growth phase: Real growth = (1 + careerGrowthRate) ÷ (1 + inflationRate) - 1
     - Post-slowdown: Maintains purchasing power (grows with inflation)
   - Display all income values in today's dollars
   - Tax calculations use nominal values then convert back

4. Investment Returns

   - Input return rate is real (after inflation) return
   - Internal calculations:
     - Nominal return rate = (1 + realReturn) × (1 + inflationRate) - 1
     - Apply nominal returns for actual growth
     - Convert results back to today's dollars for display
   - All projections show purchasing power in current terms

5. FIRE Achievement Determination

   - Previous (Simplified) Method:

     - Compare real investment returns with real expenses
     - FIRE achieved when: Real investment returns ≥ Real annual expenses × 1.1
     - This method was insufficient as it didn't account for future expense changes

   - New Method (Strict Net Worth Preservation):

     1. For each potential FIRE age from current age to current age + 50:

        - Run a full lifetime simulation (until age 90 or specified end age)
        - Track net worth trajectory after retirement
        - Account for all future expenses:
          - Base retirement expenses
          - Additional retirement expenses
          - Kids expenses (if applicable)
          - Parents care expenses (if applicable)
        - Calculate required investment returns to maintain net worth:
          - Required return = Total expenses / Current net worth
          - Must be less than or equal to real investment return rate

     2. FIRE Age Requirements:

        - Net worth in today's dollars must never decrease after retirement
        - Investment returns must fully cover all expenses without touching principal
        - Must maintain sufficient buffer for expense spikes
        - Formula: Required investment return rate = Annual expenses / Net worth ≤ Real return rate

     3. Selection Criteria:

        - Choose the earliest age where:
          - Net worth is sufficient to generate required returns
          - All future expense spikes (kids, parents) can be covered by returns alone
          - Net worth in today's dollars remains stable or growing
        - Safety margin: Add 20% buffer to required net worth

     4. Implementation Strategy:
        - Binary search for optimal FIRE age
        - For each candidate age:
          - Project all future expenses
          - Calculate minimum required net worth:
            Net worth ≥ max(yearly expenses) / real return rate × 1.2
          - Simulate full retirement scenario
          - Verify net worth stability in real terms
        - Return earliest age that meets all criteria

### Data Visualization (FireCharts.tsx)

1. Net Worth Chart

   - Y-axis: All values in today's dollars
   - Shows real purchasing power over time
   - Inflation-adjusted growth trajectory
   - Should show stable or increasing trajectory after FIRE
   - Highlight expense impact periods

2. Income vs Expenses Chart
   - All values displayed in today's dollars
   - Shows real purchasing power of:
     - Income (after inflation and career growth)
     - Expenses (varying with life events)
     - Investment returns (real returns)
   - Investment returns must exceed expenses at all times after FIRE

## Input Form Updates

1. Form Labels

   - Clearly indicate all inputs are in today's dollars
   - Add tooltips explaining inflation adjustment
   - Show equivalent future values on demand

2. Results Display
   - All monetary values shown in today's dollars
   - Optional toggle to show nominal (future) values
   - Clear labeling of real vs nominal values
   - Show required vs actual investment returns

## Validation Rules

1. Input Validation

   - Real return rates must be reasonable (-2% to +12%)
   - Inflation rate range (0% to 10%)
   - Career growth must be specified in real terms
   - All monetary inputs must be in today's dollars

2. Calculation Validation
   - Verify inflation adjustments maintain purchasing power
   - Ensure real returns properly account for inflation
   - Validate all conversions between nominal and real values
   - Verify net worth stability in real terms

## Future Enhancements

1. Inflation Modeling

   - Allow different inflation rates for different expense categories
   - Model inflation rate variability over time
   - Add historical inflation data for reference

2. Visualization Enhancements

   - Add toggle between real and nominal values in charts
